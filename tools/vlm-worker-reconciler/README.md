# VLM Worker Reconciler

Go binary and Dockerfile for the post-upgrade reconciler hook Job in the `vlm-worker` Helm chart.

**Design document:** [doc/architecture/designs/0029-vlm-worker-reconciler-design.md](../../doc/architecture/designs/0029-vlm-worker-reconciler-design.md)

## What it does

Queries VCP Postgres for active ONTAP versions, applies version-hierarchy rules, and scales inactive `vlm-worker-*` Deployments to `replicas=0`. Active and migration-required workers are left untouched.

## Image

The binary is compiled into `gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot` — no shell, no package manager, non-root user. It runs as the Job's sole container with the reconcile logic embedded in the Go binary (not in the Helm template).

## Building

```bash
# Build image locally (linux/amd64 for production)
make vlm-worker-reconciler-image imageVersion=<version>

# Build and push to GAR
make vlm-worker-reconciler-push imageVersion=<version>
```

Requires `gcloud auth configure-docker us-docker.pkg.dev` before pushing.
